## Problem Statement

**What problem were you solving in this project?**

Provide an overview of the business or technical problem that your project is addressing. Explain why it’s important and how data analysis can help solve it.

Example:
_"The goal of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard to visualize sales data, identify performance trends, and help management make data-driven decisions for improving sales across various regions."_

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

List the tools and technologies you used in this project.

- **Power BI** (for visualizing and building dashboards)
- **Excel** (for data analysis and processing)
- **MySQL** (for querying and managing databases)
- **Other Tools** (e.g., Python, R, etc. if applicable)

## Data Sources

Describe where the data for this project came from.

- **Source(s):**  
  - Dataset(s) from a public source (e.g., Kaggle, company database, etc.)
  - Personal dataset
  - Other relevant data sources

Provide links to the dataset if available. If the data is sensitive, you can mention that and explain how you managed it.

Example:
_"The data was sourced from the internal sales database, which includes records of transactions for the last two years."_

## Methodology

**How did you approach solving the problem?**

Provide a step-by-step description of your process. This can include:

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**  
   - How did you collect and clean the data? Mention any data wrangling, missing values handling, or outlier detection.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Did you perform EDA to understand the data before analysis? Mention any tools like Excel pivot tables, charts, or MySQL queries you used.

3. **Data Analysis/Modeling:**  
   - Explain the key steps in your analysis. If you performed any calculations or transformations (e.g., aggregating sales data, running SQL queries), describe them.

4. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Explain how you visualized the data in Power BI. What kind of charts or visualizations did you use to present the findings?

Example:
_"I began by cleaning the dataset using Excel to remove missing values and correct data types. Afterward, I imported the cleaned data into Power BI to create visualizations that track sales performance, customer demographics, and product categories. SQL was used to query data directly from the company’s database, ensuring the dashboard was updated in real-time."_
